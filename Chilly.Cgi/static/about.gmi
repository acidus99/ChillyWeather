# About ⛄️ Chilly Weather

## What?
⛄️ Chilly Weather is a Gemini service that returns the current weather in a fun and streamlined way

Features:
* Shows current weather, next 24 hours forecast, and next 7 days forecast.
* Clear, simple presentation, prioritizing (what I think is) the most important weather data
* Uses Emoji *and* a description to represent weather conditions. Because "🌤" is more skimmable than "Scattered cloudy"
* Chilly uses your client's IP to geolocate you, and looks up the weather from there.
* You can also search for a location and see the weather there.
* No need to select the metric, or displaying both Fahrenheit and Celsius. Chilly uses the country you are in to decide the units to display.

## So... Celsius?
As a nerd, I appreciate the value of Celsius for scientific applications. But it a complete garbage scale to use for human-range temperatures. If you want to be depraved, I'm not going to stop you.

## Why?
Where possible, I want to use simple services in Gemini instead of HTTP/HTML. So that means ignoring most web-based weather services.

While there are a few weather services in Gemini, none of them presented the data that I cared about, in a format that I found easy to read. Also, I think weather apps are cool to hack on because, while getting the data isn't necessarily hard, there are so many fun challenges and choices for how display it:
* What metrics do you care about? (temperature vs "feels like" temperature, barometric pressure, humidity chance of precipitation, wind)
* What events do you care about? (sunrise, sunset, moon, etc)
* How do optimize for readability? ("Cloudy overnight with showers starting around 2am" vs a list of times and conditions)

I could probably endlessly hack on Chilly Weather.

## How?
For weather data, Chilly uses OpenWeather's API:
=> https://openweathermap.org OpenWeather

For IP-to-location, Chilly uses Free IP API:

Chilly also uses Gemini.Cgi, a reusable CGI framework:

## Let me see the code!
Sure. You can access it via Gemini or HTTP
